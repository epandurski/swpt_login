Swaptacular service that manages OAuth2 login and consent
=========================================================

This project implements user registration, login, and authorization
consent for [Swaptacular]. The ultimate deliverable is a docker image,
which is generated from the project's
[Dockerfile](../master/Dockerfile).

**IMPORTANT NOTE: Organizations running Swaptacular debtors and
creditors agents are encouraged to use their own OAuth2 login and
consent implementations, which take into account their concrete
security and user management policies.**


Dependencies
------------

Containers started from the generated docker image must have access to
the following servers:

1. [PostgreSQL] server instance, which stores users' data.

2. [Ory Hydra] [OAuth 2.0] authorization server, which generates and
   verifies access tokens.

3. A [Redis]-compatible server instance, which stores more or less
   transient login data. For this kind of information, the tolerance
   for data loss is high, but nevertheless, the Redis-compatible
   server instance must be configured as persistent (on-disk)
   database.

To increase security and performance, it is highly recommended that
you configure HTTP reverse-proxy server(s) (like [nginx]) between your
clients and your login and Ory Hydra servers.


Configuration
-------------

The behavior of the running container can be tuned with environment
variables. Here are the most important settings with some random
example values:

```shell
# Set this to the base URL of ORY Hydra's admin API. Note that Ory
# Hydra 2.0 adds an "/admin/" prefix to all endpoints in the admin
# API. Therefore, for Ory Hydra < 2.0, the value of HYDRA_ADMIN_URL
# would be something like this: "http://hydra:4445/".
HYDRA_ADMIN_URL=http://hydra:4445/admin/

# The prefix added the user ID to form the Oauth2 subject field. Must be
# either "creditors:" or "debtors:". For example, if SUBJECT_PREFIX=creditors:,
# the OAuth2 subject for the user with ID=1234 would be "creditors:1234".
SUBJECT_PREFIX=debtors:

# The specified number of processes ("$WEBSERVER_PROCESSES") will be
# spawned to handle HTTP requests (default 1), each process will run
# "$WEBSERVER_THREADS" threads in parallel (default 3). The container
# will listen for HTTP requests on port "$WEBSERVER_PORT" (default 8080).
WEBSERVER_PORT=8000
WEBSERVER_PROCESSES=1
WEBSERVER_THREADS=3

# Optional path (only the path) to the login page. If not set,
# depending on the value of the SUBJECT_PREFIX variable, the default
# will be either "/creditors-login" or "/debtors-login".
LOGIN_PATH=

# Optional path (only the path) to the consent page. If not set,
# depending on the value of the SUBJECT_PREFIX variable, the default
# will be either "/creditors-consent" or "/debtors-consent".
CONSENT_PATH=

# The URL for the PostgreSQL database that the login and consent apps should use.
POSTGRES_URL=postgresql+psycopg://swpt_login:swpt_login@localhost:5435/test

# Optional URL for a read-only replica of the master PostgreSQL
# database (specified by `POSTGRES_URL`). Using multiple
# read-only replicas behind a load-balancer may increase the number of
# user requests that a busy system can handle. If not set, the
# `POSTGRES_URL` will also be used for the read-only operations.
POSTGRES_REPLICA_URL=

# Optional upper limit on the number of PostgreSQL connections in the
# connection pool. If set to zero, which is the default value, there
# is no limit.
POSTGRES_CONNECTION_POOL_SIZE=100

# Set this to the URL for the Redis-compatible server instance which
# the login and consent apps should use. It is highly recommended that
# your Redis-compatible instance is backed by disk storage. If not so,
# your users might be inconvenienced when your Redis instace is
# restarted.
REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379/0

# Optional URL for one of the nodes of the Redis Cluster which the
# login and consent apps should use, instead of using a single Redis
# server instance. If set, `REDIS_URL` will be ingored. When
# connecting to a Redis Cluster, usually it is a good idea to specify
# more than one cluster node. In practice, however, a Kubernetes
# service will always be used. "redis://my-cluster-service:30001/0"
# for example.
REDIS_CLUSTER_URL=

# Set this to the name of your site, as it is known to your users.
SITE_TITLE=Demo Debtors Agent

# Set this to an URL that tells more about your site.
ABOUT_URL=https://example.com/about

# Optional URL to go to, after a successful sign-up. Note that setting
# this will greatly improve users' experience!
SIGNED_UP_REDIRECT_URL=

# Optional URL for users to go to, to recover their wrongfully
# suspended accounts. This is not needed if no user accounts have
# ever been suspended.
SUSPENDED_ACCOUNT_HELP_URL=https://example.com/help

# Optional URL for a custom CSS style-sheet.
STYLE_URL=

# SMTP server connection parameters. You should set MAIL_SERVER to the
# name of your mail server, and MAIL_PORT to the SMTP port on that
# server. MAIL_DEFAULT_SENDER should be set to the email address from
# which outgoing emails will be sent to users. Do not set
# MAIL_USERNAME and MAIL_PASSWORD if the SMPT server does not
# require username and password. MAIL_USE_SSL detemines whether SSL
# is required from the beginning, and MAIL_USE_TLS determines
# whether the STARTTLS extension should be used after the connection
# to the mail server has bee established.
MAIL_SERVER=my-mail-server
MAIL_PORT=25
MAIL_USE_TLS=False
MAIL_USE_SSL=False
MAIL_USERNAME=smtp_user
MAIL_PASSWORD=smpt_password
MAIL_DEFAULT_SENDER=Demo Debtors Agent <no-reply@example.com>

# Parameters for hCaptcha. You should obtain your own
# "sitekey"/"sitekey secret" pair from https://www.hcaptcha.com/, and
# put it here. Note that the "sitekey secret" should be kept secret.
CAPTCHA_SITEKEY=10000000-ffff-ffff-ffff-000000000001
CAPTCHA_SITEKEY_SECRET=0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000

# When set to `False`, does not show any CAPTCHAs. Normally, this
# should be `True`.
SHOW_CAPTCHA_ON_SIGNUP=True

# Parameters that determine how to obtain an user ID from the resource
# server. "$SUPERUSER_CLIENT_ID" and "$SUPERUSER_CLIENT_SECRET" are
# used to perform the "Client Credentials" OAuth2 flow against the
# OAuth2 token endpoint ("$API_AUTH2_TOKEN_URL"), so as to get the
# permissions to create and deactivate users. New users will be
# created and deactivated by sending requests to
# "$API_RESOURCE_SERVER". The timeout for the Web API requests will be
# "$API_TIMEOUT_SECONDS" seconds (default 5).
SUPERUSER_CLIENT_ID=debtors-superuser
SUPERUSER_CLIENT_SECRET=debtors-superuser
API_AUTH2_TOKEN_URL=https://my-nginx-ingress/debtors-hydra/oauth2/token
API_RESOURCE_SERVER=https://my-nginx-ingress
API_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=5

# Settings for the `flush_*` commands. The specified number of
# processes ("$FLUSH_PROCESSES") will be spawned to process pending
# tasks (default 1). Note that FLUSH_PROCESSES can be set to 0, in
# which case, the container will not process any pending tasks. The
# "$FLUSH_PERIOD" value specifies the number of seconds to wait
# between two sequential database queries for obtaining pending tasks
# (default 2).
FLUSH_PROCESSES=2
FLUSH_PERIOD=1.5

# Set the minimum level of severity for log messages ("info",
# "warning", or "error"). The default is "warning".
APP_LOG_LEVEL=info

# Set format for log messages ("text" or "json"). The default is
# "text".
APP_LOG_FORMAT=text
```

Available commands
------------------

The [entrypoint](../master/docker/entrypoint.sh) of the docker
container allows you to execute the following *documented commands*:

* `configure`

  Initializes a new empty PostgreSQL database for the login Web
  server.

  **IMPORTANT NOTE: This command has to be run only once (at the
  beginning), but running it multiple times should not do any harm.**

* `webserver`

  Starts a login Web server. This command allows you to start as many
  web servers as necessary, to handle the incoming load.

  **IMPORTANT NOTE: You must start at least one container with this
  command.**

* `flush_activate_users`

  Starts a process that periodically processes unprocessed rows from
  the *activate_user_signal* table. When some Web server process is
  unexpectedly terminated, some rows in that table may remain
  unprocessed. This command will take care of them.

  **IMPORTANT NOTE: You must start at least one container with this
  command. Normally, one container should be enough.**

* `flush_deactivate_users`

  Starts a process that periodically processes unprocessed rows from
  the *deactivate_user_signal* table. When a user decides to delete
  his/her account, a row is added to that table. This command
  finalizes the user deactivation process.

  **IMPORTANT NOTE: You must start at least one container with this
  command. Normally, one container should be enough.**

* `await_migrations`

  Blocks until the latest migration applied to the PostgreSQL server
  instance matches the latest known migration.


How to run the tests
--------------------

1.  Install [Docker Engine] and [Docker Compose].

2.  To create an *.env* file with reasonable defalut values, run this
    command:

        $ cp development.env .env

3.  To run the unit tests, use the following commands:

        $ docker-compose build
        $ docker-compose run tests-config test


How to setup a development environment
--------------------------------------

1.  Install [Poetry](https://poetry.eustace.io/docs/).

2.  Create a new [Python](https://docs.python.org/) virtual
    environment and activate it.

3.  To install dependencies, run this command:

        $ poetry install

4.  To run the minimal set of services needed for development, use
    this command:

        $ docker-compose up --build

    This will start its own PostgreSQL server instance in a docker
    container, but will rely on being able to connect to a RabbitMQ
    server instance at "amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672". The OAuth
    2.0 authorization will be bypassed.

5.  You can use `flask run -p 5000` to run a local web server, and
    `pytest --cov=swpt_login --cov-report=html` to run the tests and
    generate a test coverage report.
